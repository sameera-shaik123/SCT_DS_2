# SCT_DS_2
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on Titanic dataset to identify survival patterns and key variable relationships.
# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🛳️
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover key insights and trends related to passenger survival.
## 📌 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
- Identify relationships between variables and survival
- Visualize patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib
## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
## 📊 Summary of Insights
- **Females** had a higher survival rate than males
- **1st-class passengers** were more likely to survive than 2nd or 3rd class
- **Children under 10** had better survival chances
- Higher **fare** correlated positively with survival
- Key factors influencing survival: `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Fare`, and `Age`
## 📈 Output
Visualizations include:
- Histograms, countplots, KDE plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Pairplots for multivariate relationship checks
## ✅ Conclusion
This project gives a clear overview of how survival was influenced by multiple factors on the Titanic. It is a beginner-friendly data science task that strengthens EDA, visualization, and insight extraction skills.
